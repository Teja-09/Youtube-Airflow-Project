# Apache Airflow Project for YouTube Comment Analysis

## Introduction
This project uses Apache Airflow to orchestrate the process of extracting comments from YouTube videos, storing them, and performing analysis. It automates the workflow in a manageable, repeatable, and scalable way.

## Installation Commands
To set up your environment for running this Apache Airflow project, you will need to install several dependencies including Airflow itself and libraries for data manipulation and API interactions. Run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip install apache-airflow
sudo pip install pandas
sudo pip install s3fs # For interacting with S3 buckets, if needed
sudo pip install tweepy # For handling Twitter API, optional depending on project scope

## Airflow Configuration
Apache Airflow is utilized to manage the workflow of the project which involves scheduling, orchestrating, and monitoring the tasks effectively. This project's Airflow setup includes:

- **DAG Definition**: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) named `youtube_dag.py` defines the sequence of tasks for extracting, processing, and analyzing YouTube comments.
- **Task Organization**: The DAG includes tasks for starting the workflow, extracting comments, transforming the data for analysis, and loading the processed data for further use or reporting.

## ETL Process
The core of the data handling is managed through an ETL script `youtube_etl.py`, which includes:

- **Extract**: The script uses YouTube's API to fetch comments based on specified criteria such as video IDs or search terms.
- **Transform**: Data is cleaned and formatted to ensure quality and consistency, making it suitable for analysis.
- **Load**: The final step involves saving the transformed data in a structured format, such as a CSV file or a database, for subsequent analysis or reporting.

## Analytical Potential
This Airflow-based setup not only automates the data extraction process but also ensures that the data is ready for insightful analysis, such as sentiment analysis, trending topics identification, or viewer engagement patterns.
